## What does DFOnline have?

DFOnline is in a very Beta version, so few features exist currently, but the current ones are as follow:
- Edit templates, and import them with [CodeUtilities](https://codeutilities.github.io/).
- View templates, and verify your minecraft account.
- Load templates from URLs.

The planned features:
- Some sort of marketplace, like CodeVault online, using the DFOnline account.
- Allow anyone to use DFOnline accounts for DF related authentication, I hope to use OAuth2 ~~however it works~~

## How to contribute
Fork the project and work from there.  
Run `npm i`, that should install all dependancies.  
Run `npm test` to launch a test server at http://localhost:1234, it should automatically update with changes you make.  
If you want to fully build the project, use `npm run build` to build the project to ./docs  
There are also configurations in .vscode/launch.json
