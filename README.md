## What does DFOnline have?

DFOnline is in a very Beta version, so few features exist currently, but the current ones are as follow:
- Edit templates, and import them with [CodeUtilities](https://codeutilities.github.io/).
- View templates, and verify your minecraft account.
- Load templates from URLs.

The planned features:
- Some sort of marketplace, like CodeVault online, using the DFOnline account.
- Allow anyone to use DFOnline accounts for DF related authentication, I hope to use OAuth2 ~~however it works~~
