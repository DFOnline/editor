# How to contribute
Fork the project and work from there.  
Run `npm i`, that should install all dependancies.  
Run `npm test` to launch a test server at http://localhost:1234, it should automatically update with changes you make.  
If you want to fully build the project, use `npm run build` to build the project to ./docs  
There are also configurations in .vscode/launch.json

## What I kinda want
The project is in TypeScript, so I kind of don't want a mess of errors with JavaScript written in a TypeScript file.  
Use SCSS. It's cool ðŸ˜Ž, and makes things easy to read.  
If something is complex for everyone's sanity perhaps add comments.  
No swer ðŸ¥º
